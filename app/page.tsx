        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          This is Md. Emon Hossen, a MERN Stack Developer from Bangladesh. I've self-taught all the tech stacks I use, such as React JS, Redux, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. âœŒ<br /> <br />
          I consider myself fortunate to be able to develop and optimize web applications for a living. My deep interest in the web platform and SaaS products drives me to create results-driven digital solutions for my clients while becoming part of meaningful businesses along the way. <br /> <br />
          I've developed over 50 websites and worked closely with the founders of various startups. In addition, I've committed my time to three startups full-time, assisting them in hiring and managing their technical teams. I am excited to become a part of your journey. <br /> <br />
          Recently, I developed a digital marketing platform called The Run Digital. We help entrepreneurs define and achieve their web goals through our web-based solutions. We are driven by key performance indicators (KPIs) to ensure success.
