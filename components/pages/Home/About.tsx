                This is Imran Naazir Emon, a MERN Stack Developer from{" "}
                <span>Bangladesh</span>. I&apos;ve self-taught all the tech
                stacks I use, such as React JS, Redux, Next.js, and Tailwind
                CSS. âœŒ<br />
                <br />
                I consider myself fortunate to be able to develop and optimize
                web applications for a living. My deep interest in the web
                platform and SaaS products drives me to create results-driven
                digital solutions for my clients while becoming part of
                meaningful businesses along the way.
                <br />
                <br />
                I&apos;ve developed over 50 websites and worked closely with the
                founders of various startups. In addition, I&apos;ve committed
                my time to three startups full-time, assisting them in hiring
                and managing their technical teams. I am excited to become a
                part of your journey.
                <br />
                <br />
                Recently, I developed a digital marketing platform called The
                Run Digital. We help entrepreneurs define and achieve their web
                goals through our web-based solutions. We are driven by key
                performance indicators (KPIs) to ensure success.
